Riftbar is a **Waybar-like status bar** written in **Rust**, designed to be fast, safe, and modern. It uses **GTK4** for GUI and **Tokio** for asynchronous tasks, making it suitable for Wayland compositors like Sway, Hyprland, and Wayfire.

## Features

- Async updates using Tokio
- Layer-shell support for Wayland
- Modular design for CPU, network, battery, clock, and more
- Lightweight and fast, leveraging Rustâ€™s safety

## TODO

- [ ] Add Hyprland workspace integration
- [ ] Calendar sub-widget
- [ ] Custom style via style.css / SCSS
- [ ] Tray for system resources
- [ ] Configuration file using TOML
