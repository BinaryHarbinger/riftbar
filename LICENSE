                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2025 BinaryHarbinger
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
 any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
 your programs, too.

 Terms and Conditions

 0. Definitions.

 "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

 "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.

 "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

 To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

 A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
 on the Program.

 To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
 public, and in some countries other activities as well.

 To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
 parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

 An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
 to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
 extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
 work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
 the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

 1. Source Code.

 The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
 for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
 form of a work.

 A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 is widely used among developers working in that language.

 2. Basic Permissions.

 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
 rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
 measures.

 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
 conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
       it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
       released under this License and any conditions added under
       section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section
       4 to “keep intact all notices”.

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
       License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
       License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
       additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
       regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
       permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
       invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
       Appropriate Legal Notices; however, it is permitted to display
       them in a modified form that is consistent with the functionality
       of the interface.

 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
 sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
 Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
 ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
       (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
       Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
       customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
       place (including a network server) and offer equivalent access
       to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
       place at no further charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
       written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.

    d) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
       you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
       Source of the work are being offered to the public.

 7. Additional Terms.

 You may add additional permissions or conditions as long as they do
 not contradict this License. Refer to the official GPLv3 text for
 full details.

 8. Termination.

 Any violation of this License is grounds for termination of your
 rights under it. Rights may be reinstated if violations are corrected.

 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

 You are not required to accept this License to receive or run a copy
 of the Program. Ancillary permissions are granted for certain uses
 even if you do not accept the License.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensors to copy, modify and
 propagate that work subject to this License. You are not responsible
 for enforcing compliance by third parties.

 11. Disclaimer of Warranty.

 THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
 HOLDERS PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
 EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.

 12. Limitation of Liability.

 IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE
 FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE PROGRAM.

 13. Interpretation of Sections.

 If any provision of this License is held invalid or unenforceable,
 the remainder of the License is interpreted in a manner that best
 preserves the intent of the original authors.
